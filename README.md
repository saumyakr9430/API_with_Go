## 🛠 Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-mongodb-docker-api.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd go-mongodb-docker-api
   ```
3. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t go-mongo-api .
   ```
4. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 go-mongo-api
   ```
5. Access the API at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```
